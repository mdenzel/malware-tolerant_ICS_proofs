## Quick Start

*REMARK: ALL PROOFS REQUIRE PROVERIF v. 1.96!*

Simply run the shellscript in the command-line:

```
	$ sh ./run_all.sh
```

(tested on Fedora 25; ProVerif v. 1.96)

Keywords:

```
plc          = Programmable Logic Controller
2oo3         = 2-out-of-3 circuit
r            = reset circuit
success      = proof reaches the end of the protocol
YES          = ProVerif file proves the property
NO           = ProVerif file does not prove the property
```

There is also a self-explanatory CONFIG section in `run_all.sh`.



## Running ProVerif Manually

Since there are 24 proofs for every configuration, we generate the proofs from
the `*.gen` files using the C-pre-processor. The `run_all.sh` script has an option
(ONLY_GENERATE) to generate the proofs without running them.

Afterwards the ProVerif files are in the sub-folder `./proofs/proofs-*`. They
can be run separately and are named by the compromised devices.

```
plc  = compromised Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
2oo3 = compromised 2-out-of-3 circuit
r    = compromised reset circuit
```

To run a proof, execute for example the following:

```
    $ proverif ./proofs/proofs-selfhealing_proverif.gen/24_all_compromised.pv
```

*REMARK:*
success is a (dummy) secret which gets leaked at the end
of the protocol to indicate that it ran through. Thus,
when running manually, ProVerif should return `false` or
the following output:

```
The attacker has the message success in phase 1.
A trace has been found.
RESULT not attacker_p1(success[]) is false.
```
